# data/subs.json

Here is your blacklist, the bot will get the subs from this list every time it needs them, so no need to restart the bot after changing it.

e.g.
```json
{
    "banned_subs": ["redditdev", "learnpython"]
}
```
> here the subs r/redditdev and r/learnpython are blacklisted, and any crosspost from them will be deleted.
